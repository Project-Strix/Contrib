Implementations of recent research prototypes / networks / datasets / losses. Please feel free to share your research.

You can share your either network, loss, dataset or whole project.
Upload your contributions to the individual folder. 

For example:

Your want to share your neural network named "MyUNet". You can upload a folder named "MyUNet" containing the python script. Strix will detect the registered network automatically. The final file structure will be like:
```bash
├── Networks
│   ├── MyUNET
